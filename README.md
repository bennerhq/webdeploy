#
# The main purpose of the project to make it extreamly easy to upload a
# "web application" by uploading a single .html file
#
# This is done by reading ./index.html and creating one file (./deploy.index.html) 
# that containes all external files refarnces (scripts, styles and images).
# deploy.index.html is a self containes "application" without any dependecies
# or referances to external files.
#
# It's not a "bullet proff" solution, but for simple "web application"
# it's okay!
